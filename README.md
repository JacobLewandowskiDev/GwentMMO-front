# Gwent: The Card Game MMORPG Frontend

## Description
This repository contains the frontend portion of Gwent: The Card Game MMORPG project â€” a browser-based multiplayer RPG inspired by Gwent and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, built with Vue.js and Vite.

Players can create their character, choose a unique username, and dive into a pixel-art world set in the gritty, medieval-fantasy universe of The Witcher.
Once created, characters enter a small in-game server where they can roam freely, explore the environment, and immerse themselves in the rich atmosphere.

Interact with others through a global chat or challenge fellow adventurers to a friendly game of Gwent.
